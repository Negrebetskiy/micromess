.SH DESCRIPTION
.B umess 
spawns a small popup window with dimensions adjusted to its contents.
Output data is passed to micromess stdin as an output of a user script. There 
are nine possible popup positions, manual coordinates setting is not supported. 
Its main aim is to get rid of bars and panels usage as they waste to much place,
distract user and, on the other hand, fail to get user's attention in urgent
cases, such as critical battery discharge.
