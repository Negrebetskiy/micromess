micromess - a simple X pop-up 
=============================

umess spawns a small pop-up window with dimensions adjusted to its contents.
Its main aim is to get rid of bars and panels usage as they waste to much
place, distract user and, on the other hand, fail to get user's attention in 
urgent cases, such as critical battery discharge.


Installation
------------
Edit the first lines of the Makefile to fit your preferences and run:

    $ make install


Basic usage
-----------
Following spawns a pop-up message in the right-bottom corner of active monitor,
that would stay alive for 2 seconds: 

    $ (printf "onelinestr\n"; sleep 2) | umess -rb

User can specify background and foreground color, font (in Xft notation), pop-up
position. With no option provided pop-up appears in the middle of the screen.
See manpage for more information.
