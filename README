micromess - a simple X popup 
============================

micromess spawns a small popup window with dimensions adjusted to its contents.
Its main aim is to get rid of ineffective and space wasting bars usage.


Installation
------------
Edit the first lines of Makefile to fit your system and run

    make install


Basic usage
-----------
This should spawn a popup message in the right-bottom corner of active monitor,
that would stay alive for 2 seconds: 

  (printf "onelinestr\n"; sleep 2) | umess -rb

User can specify background and foreground color, font (in Xft notation), popup
position. With no option provided popup appears in the middle of the screen.
