micromess - a simple X pop-up 
=============================

umess spawns a small pop-up window with dimensions adjusted to its contents. Its
main aim is to get rid of bars and panels usage as they waste too much place,
distract user and, on the other hand, fail to get user's attention in urgent
cases, such as critical battery discharge.


Installation
------------
Edit the first lines of the Makefile to fit your preferences and run:

    $ make install

Arch Linux users can get umess from AUR:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/umess-git
Great thanks to RaafatTurki, who maintains this package.


Basic usage
-----------
Following spawns a pop-up message in the right-bottom corner of active monitor, 
that would stay alive for 2 seconds: 

    $ (printf "onelinestr\n"; sleep 2) | umess -rb

User can specify colors, font (in Xft notation) and pop-up position. By default it 
appears in the center of the screen. See manpage for more options.
