micromess - a simple X pop-up 
=============================

umess spawns a small pop-up window with dimensions adjusted to its contents.
Its main aim is to get rid of ineffective and space wasting bars usage.


Installation
------------
Edit the first lines of the Makefile to fit your system and run:

    make install


Basic usage
-----------
This should spawn a pop-up message in the right-bottom corner of active monitor,
that would stay alive for 2 seconds: 

  (printf "onelinestr\n"; sleep 2) | umess -rb

User can specify background and foreground color, font (in Xft notation), pop-up
position. With no option provided pop-up appears in the middle of the screen.

An example of umess usage (low battery warning):

See manpage for more information.

Problems
--------
- strange offset behaviour
- dying on click takes some time or just ignores first click
